# Pilot Proposal: Cybernetic Peace Loop Integration at [RMO Name]

## 1. Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a 90-day pilot program to integrate the Cybernetic Peace Loop—an AI-augmented peace stewardship system—into the existing Resonance Monitoring Observatory (RMO) at [Community Name]. The pilot aims to validate the effectiveness of AI-assisted resonance monitoring and to refine the system for broader deployment.

## 2. Background

The MPT-SST framework has established the theoretical foundation for peace as a governable social technology. The Cybernetic Peace Loop operationalizes this by providing:
- Real-time metaphysical coherence monitoring
- Trust density analytics
- Consciousness Early Warning Interface (CEWI)
- Integrated Peace Operating System (IPOS) dashboard

## 3. Pilot Objectives

1. **Quantitative**: Reduce time to detect emerging dissonance by 40%.
2. **Qualitative**: Increase steward confidence in intervention decisions by 25%.
3. **System Validation**: Test the AI modules in a real-world RMO setting.
4. **Community Feedback**: Assess the community's response to AI-assisted stewardship.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1. Phase 1: Baseline (30 days)
- Traditional stewardship without AI tools
- Data collection: time to detection, intervention outcomes, steward logs

### 4.2. Phase 2: Intervention (60 days)
- Stewards use the IPOS dashboard
- Daily review of AI-generated "mirror data"
- Logging of AI suggestions and steward actions

### 4.3. Metrics
- **Speed**: Time from event to steward awareness
- **Accuracy**: Steward vs. AI assessment vs. ground truth (post-factum survey)
- **Efficacy**: Biometric stress indicators (aggregate, anonymous) pre/post intervention

## 5. Technology Requirements

- Secure cloud server for dashboard
- Tablets for stewards (if needed)
- Data encryption and anonymization protocols
- MPVOC tailored to community lexicon

## 6. Ethical Considerations

- All data is community-owned and anonymized.
- Stewards have veto power over AI suggestions.
- Transparent algorithms: MPVOC and metrics are open for community review.

## 7. Timeline

- Week 1-2: Preparation and setup
- Week 3-4: Baseline data collection
- Week 5-10: Intervention phase
- Week 11-12: Evaluation and reporting

## 8. Success Criteria

- >40% reduction in diagnostic time
- >25% increase in steward confidence scores
- Positive correlation between AI alerts and community friction reports

## 9. Next Steps

1. Community consent and stewardship training
2. MPVOC refinement with local terminology
3. Dashboard deployment and testing
4. Pilot launch
